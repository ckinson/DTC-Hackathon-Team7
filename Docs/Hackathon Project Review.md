# Project Review - Team 7

**How We Started**

Our aim at the start of the project was to gain an overview of the tasks that needed to be done, that way we could allocate everybody's time evenly on tasks that played to their strengths. We opted for the agile Kanban organisation method using sticky notes and whiteboard diagrams. This method worked well as it allowed us to see where each team member was at in the project and we knew what everyone was working on. We split our columns into: backlog, to-do, in progress, blockers and closed respectively, we felt this worked well as the further to the right we were, the further along the project we were (except for the blockers column of course).

**Project Plan**

When we began working, we didn't assign specific roles and instead we each discussed different tasks that we thought needed doing. This worked well as it had four different individuals thinking about the project as a whole and thus we thought of crucial tasks that needed doing that wouldn't have been thought of if it was only one person deciding the tasks. We split the tasks up amongst ourselves which played to each person's strength, for example, Ben took up programming the scripts as that was his strength whereas Harry took up developing a database to use. This way of assigning tasks worked extremely well as it wasn't the case of splitting tasks up evenly solely for the sake of fairness, it was split up evenly with regards to each person's strength to get tasks finished efficiently and to a high quality.

**Issues During Development**

At the start of our development, although we had a list of tasks that we knew needed to be completed, we didn't have the technical knowledge to complete them, so we had to spend a large chunk of time going over tutorials and documentation in order to fully understand the amazon web services we were using such as Amazon Kenisis. This issue could have been avoided by taking time outside of the development day to go over key AWS features so we could jump straight into development without having to learn it first.

Another issue we ran into half way into the project was that we were all unsure about the architectural structure of our application and how we were going to handle the data such that it met the needs of the specification. This issue was quickly resolved after a meeting going over the architecture and the role that each piece plays however, this issue could have been avoided by being fully clear at the beginning of the project when we were all going over tasks to complete.

The major issue that we ran into was a problem with sending data to the Alexa, as we were unaware that Amazon had not released a 'Push Notifications' feature to Alexa, meaning that we weren't able to communicate with the Alexa and have it activate itself and talk to the patient. We realised this quite late into the project and had to make a large U-turn on the project and ended up with a lot of technical debt which was difficult to work around. We then came together and thought up another potential solution, by applying this solution we made more progress in the task.

**What Went Well**

Communication was quite good between the members of the team, at most points during the project we knew what people were working on and the overall goal that we were working towards. As we progressed we started collaborating together on the same task as a lot of the tasks were dependent on another so we couldn't move forward until that task had been completed. Also, a lot of the tasks involved working alongside each other so collaboration was necessary so both team members knew how each bit worked.

We came up with an abstract diagram of the project which allowed us to view what each point in the architecture was doing and how it was supposed to work. This brought the project down to a smaller scale and was easier to discuss it as we could focus on individual points such as the data stream or the storage.
